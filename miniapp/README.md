# Minimal Apartment Parser

This is a pared-down version focusing on:
- Per-user links stored in MongoDB
- Admin approval and city/link assignment
- 30-day access window upon approval
- Notifications every 30 minutes (06:00–23:30 Berlin) per user
- Kleinanzeigen: only "Heute" listings
- Immowelt: only cards with "Neu" badge

See SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md in the root for full context. This README remains minimal.
